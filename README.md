## Description

This repository contains my project for the Swift Student Challenge 2024. The "SetMeUp" app is an interactive playground designed to help users learn how to assemble a PC in a simple and fun way while gaining familiarity with various component functionalities.

## How It Works

The app revolves around a series of riddles related to PC components. Users are challenged to drag the correct components into an empty case to assemble the PC step by step. Each component dragged into the case is properly placed and contributes to the construction of the final PC.

Additionally, users can click on each component to view a description of its functionalities. This helps users understand the role of each component in the PC and become familiar with technical vocabulary without being overwhelmed by complicated terms.

## Purpose

The main goal of "SetMeUp" is to make learning how to build a PC accessible to everyone, without the need to tackle complex and technical descriptions. This app is particularly useful for those who are new to the world of PC building and desire a clear and straightforward introduction to its components and functionalities.
